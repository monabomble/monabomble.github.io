Hi. I'm Andy. 👋🏻 

I'm a somewhat technical person interested in computer security and home automation. Over the years I've done some pretty interesting projects both in my personal and professional life, and I have relied heavily on the generosity of others sharing their knowledge. This blog is my attempt to pay it forward. Hopefully, I'll be able to put at least a few bits up here before I find something else to distract me.
